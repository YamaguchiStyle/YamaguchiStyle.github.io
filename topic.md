# What is Drifting?
Drifting is a motorsport with emphasis placed on the manipulation of traction in order to navigate turns in a stylistic way. Rather than simply navigating a turn in the traditional fashion, when drifting, an individual utilizes a variety of techniques in order to overcome the mechanical grip provided by the tires and induce a slide. While it may outwardly appear that the intent of one who is drifting is to simply overcome traction, it is through the careful management of traction that one achieves the most desireable results.
